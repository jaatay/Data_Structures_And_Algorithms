# Quicksort

## Challenge

This challenge was to implement a quicksort algorithm. A quicksort uses the combination of recursion and partitioning, somewhat similar to a binary search method. What this means is that a array of integers is taken, then pointers are set. It uses a middle pointer, which divides the array in half, then a left and right pointer at each end of the partition. 

A comparison is done between the left and right values, where if a value is greater than the left value it is moved to the right, and if a value is less than the right value it is moved to the left. This is done until the partition is sorted, where the algorithm continues with the next partition. And so on, employing a divide and conquer approach that results in the array being sorted, left to right.
